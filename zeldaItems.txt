# List of Items
# This pages lists all the items that you can find in Legend of Zelda, along with how to get them, and how to use them.
# Contents 
@ Letter : The letter is in the area that is one screen to the left of the northeastern corner of the map. If you have the letter, then you can buy medicine from the old lady who can be found in various locations.
@ Monster Bait : Monster bait can be purchased from certain shops. You will need it in a dungeon where a monster is blocking the way.
@ Wooden Sword : The wooden sword can be found in the cave that you see when you first start the game. Use it to hit enemies!
@ White Sword : The white sword can be found in the area above the waterfall in the northern part of the map, just east of center. You can only take the white sword if you have six heart containers. It does more damage than the wooden sword.
@ Magical Sword : The magical sword is the strongest sword in the game. You can only take the magical sword if you have twelve heart containers. You can find the magical sword in the graveyard in the western part of the map. To reach the graveyard, you have to go North, West, South, West in the forest maze in the southwest part of the map. The sword is hidden under a grave in the northeast corner of the graveyard. The grave indicated by the X is the one that you need to push to reach the magical sword:

O O X O

@ Magic Shield : You can buy the magic shield at several shops. The magic shield can protect you from fireballs, unlike the shield that you start the game with. But be careful, because Like-Likes can eat your magic shield, and you can only get another one by purchasing one at a shop.
@ Boomerang : The boomerang is found in Dungeon 1. When you throw it, it comes back to you. If you hit an enemy with it, the enemy will temporarily be stunned. You can also throw the boomerang to collect distant items like rupees (but it doesn't work on certain items).
@ Magic Boomerang : The magic boomerang is found in Dungeon 2 (in the second quest, it is found in Dungeon 3). It goes farther when you throw it, but otherwise it does the same things as the regular boomerang.
@ Bomb : When you put a bomb down, it will explode a few moments later. You can use this to damage enemies, and in some places you can bomb walls to reveal hidden areas. You can purchase bombs in some shops, or you can get free bombs by killing certain enemies. Specifically, there is a 30% chance of getting a bomb from Blue Octoroks, Blue Moblins, Blue Lynels, Red Goriyas, Gibdos, Vire, Red Darknuts, and Red Wizzrobes. Also, you can get bombs from other enemies if you kill ten consecutive enemies without getting hit if you kill the tenth enemy with a bomb (the dropped bomb is worth 4 bombs).
@ Bow and Arrows : You find the Bow in Dungeon 1 (in the second quest, it is found in dungeon 5). However, you can't use it if you don't have arrows. You can purchase arrows at some shops, and there are also some enemies that drop them. Once you have some arrows, you can use the bow to shoot arrows, which damage enemies. Using an arrow costs one rupee.
@ Silver Arrows : You will find the Silver Arrows in Dungeon 9.
@ Blue Candle : There is a shop that sells the blue candle. The blue candle can be used to shoot a flame that burns for a short time. You can only use the blue candle once in an area. Just leave the area and go back if you want to use it there again. The flame can be used to light up dark places, and it can be used to burn certain trees that have secret caves under them.
@ Red Candle : It does the same thing as the blue candle, but you can use it as many times as you want in an area. You will find it in Dungeon 7.
@ Blue Ring : When you have the blue ring, enemies will only do half as much damage to you. Link's tunic turns blue when you get this item. You can purchase it from a certain shop.
@ Red Ring : When you have the red ring, enemies will only do 1/4 as much damage to you as they did when your tunic was green. You will find the red ring in Dungeon 9.
@ Power Bracelet : The power bracelet lets you push rocks, some of which have hidden areas under them. The power bracelet is in the west half of the map, near the center. You can only reach the area by going through the graveyard in the far west of the map, and you can only get there by going North, West, South, West in the lost woods (the forest where you keep going back to the same screen if you go the wrong way). Once you get to the graveyard, go east from it until you reach a grey area with white statues, then go up the eastern exit and go east again until you are in an area with a bunch of armos statues. Touch the top-right one to reveal the power bracelet.
@ Whistle : Also known as the Recorder, this item helps you defeat one of the dungeon bosses. It can also be used to reveal a hidden dungeon. And you can use it to warp to any dungeon that you have completed thus far. Use it again to warp to the next dungeon in the sequence. If you use it when facing north or east, you go to the next dungeon in the sequence. If you use it when facing west or south, you go to the previous dungeon in the sequence. If you use it more than once before the whirlwind catches you, you will skip that many dungeons in the sequence.
@ Raft : It can be used to travel across water in certain locations. It is found in Dungeon 3 (in the second quest, it is found in dungeon 4).
@ Stepladder : It can be used to walk across gaps. It is found in Dungeon 4 (in the second quest, it is found in dungeon 6)
@ Magic Wand : You can shoot magical beams with this item. It is found in Dungeon 6 (in the second quest, it is found in dungeon 8).
@ Magic Book : If you have the magic book, then the magic wand will shoot fire. It is found in Dungeon 8 (in the second quest, it is found in dungeon 4).
@ Magic Key : This is just like the regular keys that you find in dungeons and shops, except that it doesn't disappear after you use it, so you never have to look for keys again. It is found in Dungeon 8.
